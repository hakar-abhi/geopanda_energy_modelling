# geopanda_energy_modelling
Contains code that uses geopandas package to plot the geodataframe into 2D projections.
Cartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing and has exposed an interface to enable easy map creation using matplotlib. There are several types of projections, earth is a sphere object but for our visualizations we project 3D data into 2D flat surface which loses information, it is up to us to choose the kind of projection we want to use.
